Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications (or just 'web apps') electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. </p>\n<h3>CMS</h3>\n<p>Among web professionals, \"web development\" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding.
